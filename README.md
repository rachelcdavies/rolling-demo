This project provides a demo of how you can build a dynamic form using [rolling-fields](https://github.com/tes/rolling-fields).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses a custom hook for form input based on [hooks-form](https://github.com/rajatk16/hooks-form).

To run:

```npm start```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
